LF Helpdesk / Service Desk
##########################

The `service desk <https://support.linuxfoundation.org>`_ is a support platform
for administrative and infrastructure issues requiring input or action from
members of the Linux Foundation IT staff.

Choose "**Project Services**" as your support category and then start typing your
question into the field provided. As you type, the system will suggest knowledge
base articles that may help you find an applicable self-service solution.

If none of the suggested articles are helping you resolve your problem, please
navigate the menus under the input field to select the category that best
reflects the nature of your request.

We can help you faster and better if you provide a detailed explanation of the
problem in the description field of your new support request. Once you submit
the request, you can track its status by selecting "Requests->My Requests" in
the top-right of the Service Desk interface. If there are any changes to your
request, you will receive an automated email notification.

Our response time to routine support requests will vary depending on the nature
of the request and we will generally take care of issues during US business hours.
