Push patches to Gerrit
======================

Linux Foundation Release Engineers manage patches to the source code
comprising their work on Gerrit servers using a client tool called
`git-review <https://docs.openstack.org/infra/git-review/>`_.  Install
this tool either using the local package management system (ie, yum,
apt-get, zypper, etc.) or preferably using pip within a virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git-review

Flatten all changes to a single git commit.  Once the change is ready
for review, commit it locally with the '-s' argument:

.. code-block:: bash

   git commit -s

Pushing using git review
------------------------

After making the signed local commit, submit the change to Gerrit for
review, optionally specifying a topic with the '-t' argument in the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git review -t my_topic

Pushing using git push
----------------------

A basic way of pushing a patch without using git-review is by using
git push.

This is a more specific command, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   git push <remote> HEAD:refs/for/master

Where <remote> is the current branchâ€™s remote (or origin, if no remote
configuration exists for the current branch).

Notice the word "for" is explicitly intending to perform the push into Gerrit.
Using "heads" instead, will attempt to make the a push into the repository bypassing
Gerrit which can come in handy for some isolated cases (when having force push rights).
Another variable commonly used is "refs/changes/<gerrit-number>" which is an explicit
way of making an update to an exisiting gerrit. In such case, is best to let gerrit handle
this via Change-Id in the commit text.

More options for this command: `git-push https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push`_.

Push output
-----------

The output of this command will, when successful, include a link to a
web page where peers will then perform the review.  For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   (releng) cjac@probook0:/usr/src/git/lf/gerrit.linuxfoundation.org/releng/docs$ git review
   remote: Processing changes: updated: 1, refs: 1, done
   remote:
   remote: Updated Changes:
   remote:   https://gerrit.linuxfoundation.org/infra/7404 documentation on the topic of git-review
   remote:
   To ssh://gerrit.linuxfoundation.org:29418/releng/docs.git
   * [new branch]      HEAD -> refs/publish/master/git-review-docs
