Escalation

Infrastruture critical to releng:

1. Gerrit
2. Nexus
3. Jenkins

Priority is to make sure developers are able to continue working. This means
Jenkins, Nexus, and Gerrit are reachable and can perform code builds. If we
are unable to perform any builds and these services are offline then we need
to make sure someone is working on getting these servers back online.

1. Look into the problem and see if we can fix it ourselves
2. Failing that ping the IT team to help
3. Contact emergency line: emergency@linuxfoundation.org

The emergency line will ring the pager and contact whoever is on call.
