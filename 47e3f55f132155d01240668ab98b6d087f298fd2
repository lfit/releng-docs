For example we have some projects that push C++ binaries to Nexus 2 using lftools.\n\nEvery job pushes logs and archives go to Nexus 2.\n\nI wonder if it would be more useful to instead document how to push to Nexus 2 using the mvn cli or lftools or cURL ( which is what lftools uses) instead (or just link to other docs that explain that).",
